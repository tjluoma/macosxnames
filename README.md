# macosxnames.sh

This is a simple script designed to help you easily remember (or search for) information about the “code names” and version numbers of Mac OS X / OS X / macOS.

Examples:

* If you can’t remember what version “10.8” was called, use `macosxnames.sh 10.8` (or just `macosxnames.sh 8`)

* If you can’t remember which version was called “Yosemite”, use `macosxnames.sh Yosemite`

* If you want to know which versions was called “Sierra”, use `macosxnames.sh sierra`

* If you want to know which versions had “Sierra” in the name, use `macosxnames.sh ' sierra'` (note the single quotes and the space)
	(The same goes for ' leopard' and ' lion' if you want those.)

If you do not supply any input, a full list will be shown.
Oh, and finally, note that all searches are cASe INSenSitiVe.
